## Problem Statements

1. **Even-Odd Array Separation:**
   - Write a program that declares two arrays named `even` and `odd`.
   - Accept numbers from the user and move them to respective arrays depending on whether they are even or odd.

2. **Neighboring Numbers:**
   - Implement a Java function that finds 2 neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance to each.
   - The function should return the index of the first number.

3. **Array to ArrayList Conversion:**
   - Write a Java program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.

## Programs

1. **EvenOddArray.java:**
   - Contains a program to separate even and odd numbers into separate arrays.

2. **Neighbours.java:**
   - Implements a function to find neighboring numbers with the smallest distance.

3. **ArrayAndArrayList.java:**
   - Includes a program to convert an array into ArrayList and vice versa.

## Usage

To run the programs:

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```
   javac EvenOddArray.java
   javac Neighbours.java
   javac ArrayAndArrayList.java
   ```

2. **Run the programs:**
   ```
   java EvenOddArray
   java Neighbours
   java ArrayAndArrayList
   ```

Follow the on-screen prompts for input where applicable.

Feel free to explore and modify the programs to suit your needs or to further practice Java programming concepts.
