## Problem Statement

Write a menu-driven Java Program to study the concepts of classes, array of objects, instance members, and constructors in Java. The assignment description is as follows:

- Create a `Student` class describing attributes of a student like PRN (Permanent Registration Number), name, date of birth (DoB), marks, etc.
- Create an array of objects of the `Student` class.
- Perform operations like:
  - Add students
  - Display
  - Search (by PRN, by name, by position)
  - Update/Edit
  - Delete

## Program

1. **Main.java:**
   - Contains the main program implementing the menu-driven Student Management System.
   - Includes functionalities to add students, display students, search students by PRN or name, update student details, and delete a student.

2. **Student.java:**
   - Defines the `Student` class with attributes such as PRN, name, date of birth, and marks.
   - Includes constructors and methods for getting and setting student attributes.

3. **UserInput.java:**
   - Utility class for user input handling.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. **Compile the Java files:**
   ```
   javac Main.java
   javac Student.java
   javac UserInput.java
   ```

2. **Run the program:**
   ```
   java Main
   ```

Follow the on-screen menu prompts to perform various operations on the student data.

Feel free to explore and modify the program to suit your needs or to further practice Java programming concepts.
