## Files

### `Main.java`

The main class responsible for running the calculator application. It takes user input for choosing an operation and performs the calculation accordingly. It utilizes the `UserInput` class for handling user input and the `Calculator` class for performing calculations.

### `UserInput.java`

A utility class for handling user input. It provides methods to get double input, string input, and array input from the user. The `closeScanner` method is used to close the underlying `Scanner` object.

### `Calculator.java`

Contains a set of static methods for performing various calculations. It includes methods for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power) and statistical operations (mean, standard deviation, variance). The methods are designed to be reusable and can be called from other classes.

## How to Use

Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.

   ```bash
